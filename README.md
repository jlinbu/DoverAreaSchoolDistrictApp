# Dover Area School District App
The Dover App is a useful app for viewing anything related to Dover Area School District.
It allows you to check the school's website, lunch menu, calendar, and more.
Using it, you may stay up to date involving any Dover activities, like sports.
It works across all schools, so you don't have to worry about being restricted.
This is an end-of-the-year project for DASD's Computer Science A course.
